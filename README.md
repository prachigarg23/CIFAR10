# CIFAR10

This directory contains CNNs to train CIFAR10 dataset using keras, Tensorflow and Pytorch. No transfer learning has been used. Models have not been trained for required epochs due to lack of computation resources to train model from scratch. These files are just to demonstrate how the model will be constructed.
